**Dissolve** is a simulation tool for the interrogation of neutron scattering data, typically total neutron scattering data. It builds on the techniques established in the Empirical Potential Structure Refinement (EPSR) method by Soper.

**Dissolve** is in heavy ongoing development, and as such the code here is rather volatile. The [`develop`](https://github.com/projectdissolve/dissolve/tree/develop) branch should always contain a compilable, working version however.

Executable installers for all major platforms can be found on the [releases page](https://github.com/projectdissolve/dissolve/releases), including [continuous builds](https://github.com/projectdissolve/dissolve/releases/tag/continuous) from the latest source.

Various tutorial material and examples for **Dissolve** can be [found here](https://trisyoungs.github.io/dissolve/examples/).

Documentation is a work in progress, and is available [here](https://trisyoungs.github.io/dissolve).
