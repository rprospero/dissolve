'Energy / Force 4' System Test
Test improper dihedral energy and force calculation.

Reference forces calculated with MOSCITO 4.180. Thanks to D. Paschek for providing the original input files.
Only improper torsions are considered. No other forces are present in the simulation.

Specific tests are:

1. Cubic box of one Py4OH-NTf2 ion pair (py4oh/)
2. Cubic box of one Py5-NTf2 ion pair (py5/)

For the ionic liquids the forcefield of Ludwig et al. implemented in Dissolve is used.
